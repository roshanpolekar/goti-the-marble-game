To play Goti or Kancha (traditional Indian marbles), you need a flat, dry patch of ground and a set of glass marbles.
1. Setup and Determining Turns
The Ring: Draw a circle about 2–3 feet in diameter. Each player contributes an equal number of marbles (usually 2–5) to the center.
Lagging (Toss): To decide who goes first, draw a line 3–10 feet away. Players throw their "shooter" marble toward the line; the person whose marble lands closest to it gets the first turn. 
2. Basic Gameplay Rules
The Shot: Kneel outside the ring. You must keep at least one part of your hand (usually the left thumb) firmly on the ground while shooting.
Objective: Use your larger "shooter" marble to flick and knock the target marbles out of the circle.
Flicking Technique: Hold the shooter tightly against your forefinger, pull it back like a bowstring with the other hand's forefinger, and release. Alternatively, cradle it in the crook of your index finger and flick it with your thumb.
Scoring: If you knock a marble out of the ring, you collect it and continue your turn. If you miss, your turn ends.
Shooter Placement: In some versions, if you miss but your shooter stays inside the ring, you must take your next shot from that spot. 
3. Variations
Target Selection: Other players may choose a specific marble in the center that you must hit. If you hit it, you might win all the marbles in the circle at once.
Knocking Out Shooters: You can target another player's shooter marble. If you knock it out, that player may lose a turn or be forced to restart from outside the ring.
Winning: The game ends when the circle is empty. The player who has collected the most marbles wins.
